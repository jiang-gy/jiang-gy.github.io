### Getting started

-   **Tutorial:** The tutorial for our latest release is available in [HTML](https://www.nsnam.org/docs/release/3.37/tutorial/html/index.html) and [PDF](https://www.nsnam.org/docs/release/3.37/tutorial/ns-3-tutorial.pdf) versions.
-   **Installation instructions:** We typically maintain this information on our [wiki](https://www.nsnam.org/wiki/Installation).
-   **Videos:** The ns-3 Consortium has offered training and tutorial sessions at its [annual meeting](https://www.nsnam.org/research/wns3/), and recorded videos from prior sessions can be found from [this training page](https://www.nsnam.org/consortium/activities/training/). Note that due to the pandemic, in-person training sessions have not been offered since 2019. For some additional recorded sessions, please see also the [videos](https://www.nsnam.org/documentation/videos/) page.
-   **Mailing lists:** We have several [mailing lists](https://www.nsnam.org/support/mailing-lists/), but in particular, the [ns-3-users Google Group forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ns-3-users), answers many questions from people trying to get started.
-   **Chat:** ns-3 discussions also take place in a [Zulip](https://ns-3.zulipchat.com/) chatroom.

### Development

Most users will need to write new simulation scripts and possibly modify or extend the ns-3 libraries to conduct their work. The three main resources for this are our reference manual, model library documentation, and our Doxygen.

-   We maintain a **reference manual** on the ns-3 core, and a separate **model library** documentation set, also in [several formats](https://www.nsnam.org/ns-3-37/documentation/) for our latest release.
-   All of our APIs are documented using [**Doxygen**](https://www.nsnam.org/docs/release/3.37/doxygen/index.html)  【里面为程序中重要的API说明】
-   The ns-3 [coding style](https://www.nsnam.org/developers/contributing-code/coding-style/) documentation is maintained on this site.
